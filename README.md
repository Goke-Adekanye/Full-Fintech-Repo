# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list

### Project Overview
This project utilizes a powerful combination of technologies to deliver an exceptional user experience for managing financial accounts and transactions. The front-end of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, and TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript. This combination provides a highly interactive and type-safe user interface.

### Key Features
Account Management: Users can seamlessly manage their accounts, including viewing account details and balances.
Fund Transfer: Users can easily transfer funds between their own accounts or to other beneficiaries.
Fund Deposit: Users can deposit funds into their accounts, ensuring smooth financial management.
Beneficiary Management: Users can save and manage their beneficiaries, making fund transfers more convenient.
Transaction History: Users can access their complete transaction history, providing transparency and easy record-keeping.

### Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a component-based architecture and efficient rendering.
TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript, adding type safety to the codebase and improving maintainability and scalability.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid styling and ensures a sleek, responsive, and scalable user interface.

### Benefits
Interactive UI: The combination of React and TypeScript creates an engaging and responsive user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.
Type Safety: TypeScript provides type safety, catching errors during development and improving code quality and maintainability.
Rapid Styling: Tailwind CSS allows for efficient and consistent styling, enabling developers to rapidly build and iterate on the application's design.
Scalability: The chosen technologies and architecture ensure that the application can scale to accommodate growing user needs and feature requirements.
By leveraging these powerful technologies, the project delivers a robust and user-friendly platform for managing financial accounts and transactions.
